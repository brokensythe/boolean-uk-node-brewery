// Instructions
// Frontend applications will come to us asking for information about breweries. We want to offer them three different endpoints 
// - A GET endpoint /breweries to have a full list of breweries available. The return type expected is an array of objects.
// - A GET endpoint /brewery/:id to have details of a single brewery, specifying an id (e.g /brewery/:9094). The return type expected is a single object
// - A GET endpoint /breweries?brewery_type=TYPE to have a filtered list by brewery_type. The return type expected is (always) an array of objects. (e.g /breweries?brewery_type=micro should return an array of objects representing all breweries having micro as brewery_type)



// Where do we get the data about breweries?
// Real backends have a database (spoiler!) but, for today, we will use an array of objects stored "in memory", so in a simple variable in our .js file.
// To have real information, you can tour the breweries of your neighbourhood or you can copy/paste what you can find here: https://api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries
// So, at the top of your file, you should declare
// const breweries = [{"id":9094,"obdb_id.....blahblah....}]
